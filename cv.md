## Summary:
From February to October 2022, I took a course at Yandex. The workshop" is a Python developer (wrote a telegram bot, a social network and an application where users can publish their recipes).
During the course of the 9-month course, I had an idea of what and how a back-end developer should do.
At the end of July 2022, I realized with full confidence that I wanted to connect my life with web development, and since I did not have the opportunity to study fully and with full dedication, but I had the accumulated funds, I decided to quit my job and finish my studies at Yandex.Practicum", having taken up close study of new materials.
Closer to the end of the training, I was interested in the JavaScript programming language on the final project. At that moment, I realized that I first wanted to master it and become a front-end developer, in order to become a full-stack in the future as I develop.
At the moment I am taking a course at RS School on JS / Front-end. stage 0 (RU) and a JavaScript course from Bogdan Staschuk.
